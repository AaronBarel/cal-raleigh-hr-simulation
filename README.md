Simulating Cal Raleigh's home runs for the 2025-2025 season

As of writing this, 2025-06-27, Cal Raleigh has hit 32 home runs in 79 games and 347 plate appearances. This project is aiming to use MCMC methods to simulate the distribution of the number of home runs Cal Raleigh could hit this year, using his previous batting statistics and statistics from similar players, in order to to put into context how impressive his season truly is.
